Ravi Debug Adapter for VSCode
=============================

The aim is to provide a debug adapter that allows Microsoft's Visual Studio Code to step through Ravi or 
Lua code. This project contains the packaging of the debug extension; the debugger source code is part of the main Ravi source repository.

See `Ravi Visual Studio Code Debugger <https://github.com/dibyendumajumdar/ravi-vscode-debugger>`_.
